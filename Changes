  [DEPENDENCIES] 
  
  * Added Alien::TinyCC at the specific version v0.03
  
  * For testing, we now depend on Test::Exception and Test::Warn.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Differentiated between compiler warnings and errors. Still doesn't handle
    multiple warnings properly, though.
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * Build.PL indicates the proper repository and bug tracker, and indicates that
    README.pod should not be indexed. Hopefully that solves the issue of the
    REAMDE being shown instead of the module's documentation on MetaCPAN.
